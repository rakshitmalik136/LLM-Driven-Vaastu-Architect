**As an architect**, I want to quickly generate comprehensive design concepts that incorporate Vastu guidelines for both building structure and site planning, so that I can deliver complete architectural solutions and focus on client refinement rather than initial concept development.

**As an interior designer**, I want to receive Vastu-compliant room layouts with furniture placement suggestions, color recommendations, lighting design, and material specifications, so that I can create harmonious living spaces that respect traditional guidelines while meeting modern aesthetic requirements.

**As a landscape architect**, I want to generate Vastu-aware outdoor designs including garden layouts, entrance positioning, water features, and plant selections, so that I can create exterior environments that complement the building's energy flow and traditional principles.

**As a real estate developer**, I want to create multiple Vastu-compliant building and landscape packages for different plot sizes, so that I can offer complete lifestyle solutions that appeal to culturally conscious buyers.

**As a homeowner planning renovation**, I want to redesign specific interior spaces or outdoor areas with Vastu guidance, so that I can improve my existing home's energy flow and aesthetic appeal without major structural changes.

**As a construction contractor**, I want to access detailed architectural, interior, and landscape drawings with integrated Vastu annotations, so that I can ensure proper implementation of traditional principles across all project phases.

# System Architecture Design: LLM-Powered Vastu-Aware Architectural Design System

## Implementation Approach

We will implement a cloud-native microservices architecture using modern web technologies to create a comprehensive design platform that integrates architectural, interior, and exterior design capabilities with Vastu Shastra compliance. The system leverages:

**Core Technologies:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Shadcn-ui components, Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js microservices, GraphQL API gateway
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with custom fine-tuning for architectural and Vastu knowledge
- **3D Engine**: Three.js with React Three Fiber for real-time 3D visualization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for design assets, Redis for caching
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS with Kubernetes orchestration for scalability
- **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket connections with Socket.io

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Microservices Pattern**: Enables independent scaling of compute-intensive operations (3D rendering, AI processing)
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Ensures consistency across design domains using message queues
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separates read/write operations for optimal performance
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation between architectural, interior, exterior, and Vastu domains

**Open Source Libraries:**
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and visualization
- **Socket.io**: Real-time collaboration
- **Bull Queue**: Job processing for AI operations
- **Prisma**: Database ORM with type safety
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching
- **Zustand**: State management
- **React Hook Form**: Form handling with validation

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system architecture follows a domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns across architectural, interior, exterior, and Vastu compliance domains.

## Program Call Flow

The system implements a sophisticated workflow that processes natural language input through multiple AI services, generates comprehensive designs across all domains, validates Vastu compliance, and provides real-time collaboration capabilities.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Several aspects require clarification during implementation:

1. **LLM Fine-tuning Data**: Need to compile comprehensive Vastu Shastra principles, architectural standards, and design best practices for model training
2. **3D Asset Licensing**: Clarification needed on licensing terms for furniture, plant, and material 3D models
3. **Regional Vastu Variations**: Implementation approach for different regional interpretations of Vastu principles
4. **Performance Optimization**: Specific hardware requirements for real-time 3D rendering and AI processing
5. **Integration Standards**: Priority order for CAD software integrations (AutoCAD, SketchUp, Revit)
6. **Compliance Validation**: Level of professional architect review required for construction-ready outputs
7. **Scalability Thresholds**: Expected concurrent user limits and design complexity boundaries
8. **Data Privacy**: Handling of proprietary design data and intellectual property protection

# Project Summary
The project is an LLM-powered desktop application for architectural design that integrates Vastu Shastra principles into both interior and exterior layouts. It serves homeowners, architects, developers, contractors, and interior designers by enabling the creation of Vastu-compliant floor plans and structures that blend traditional cultural design with modern aesthetics. This innovative tool operates entirely offline and offers enhanced desktop capabilities.

# Project Module Description
The core modules of the project include:
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can input design commands in natural language, such as "Create a 3-bedroom house with Vastu-compliant layout."
- **3D Design Canvas**: An interactive 3D viewer for visualizing designs using Three.js.
- **Vastu Compliance Engine**: Validates designs against Vastu principles and provides real-time compliance scoring.
- **Design Generation**: Converts natural language inputs into 3D floor plans and layouts.
- **Material Library**: Provides a selection of materials, colors, and furniture for interior design.
- **Project Management**: Enables local saving and loading of projects using SQLite.
- **Export Features**: Allows exporting designs as images or in basic CAD formats.
- **Desktop Features**: Includes native menu systems, file dialogs, and offline functionality.

Performance Optimization for Desktop\n\n**Local Performance Features:**\n- **Native File I/O**: Direct file system access for faster asset loading\n- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering\n- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing for LLM inference and rendering\n- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large 3D scenes\n- **Caching Strategy**: Local file-based caching for frequently used assets\n\n**Hardware Requirements:**\n- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU, integrated graphics, 10GB storage\n- **Recommended**: 16GB RAM, 8-core CPU, dedicated GPU, 50GB storage\n- **LLM Processing**: Additional 8GB RAM for local model inference\n\n### 9. Local Asset Management\n\n**File System Organization:**\n```\n~/VastuArchitect/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 projects/           # User project files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/            # 3D models, textures, materials\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 furniture/     # Furniture 3D models\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 materials/     # Texture and material files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 plants/        # Plant and landscape models\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates/     # Design templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 models/            # LLM model files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 llama-3.1-8b/ # Primary architectural model\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 mistral-7b/   # Vastu-specialized model\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 codellama/     # Code generation model\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 database/          # SQLite database files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 exports/           # Generated CAD files and drawings\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache/             # Temporary and cache files\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/              # Application logs\n```\n\n### 10. CAD Integration and Export\n\n**Local CAD Export Service:**\n```rust\npub struct LocalCADExportService {\n    export_templates: HashMap<CADFormat, ExportTemplate>,\n    file_system: FileSystemService,\n}\n\nimpl LocalCADExportService {\n    pub async fn export_to_dwg(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate DWG file using local libraries\n        let dwg_data = self.generate_dwg_from_design(design).await?;\n        \n        // Save to user-specified location\n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(dwg_data, \"dwg\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n    \n    pub async fn export_to_pdf(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate professional PDF drawings\n        let pdf_data = self.generate_pdf_drawings(design).await?;\n        \n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(pdf_data, \"pdf\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nSeveral aspects require clarification for desktop implementation:\n\n1. **LLM Model Selection**: Which specific local models should be bundled for optimal Vastu understanding\n2. **Asset Library Size**: Balance between comprehensive asset library and application size\n3. **Regional Vastu Variations**: How to package different regional interpretations in offline mode\n4. **Hardware Compatibility**: Minimum system requirements for smooth LLM inference and 3D rendering\n5. **Update Mechanism**: Strategy for updating LLM models and asset libraries without internet\n6. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux\n7. **File Format Support**: Priority order for CAD export formats and compatibility requirements\n8. **Local Network Security**: Security protocols for LAN-based collaboration features\n\nThis desktop architecture provides a complete offline solution while maintaining all the comprehensive design capabilities of the original cloud-based system, with the added benefits of local data control, faster performance, and independence from internet connectivity.</content>\n</Editor.write>\n\n<Editor.write>\n<path>/workspace/vastu_architect_ai_class_diagram.mermaid</path>\n<content>classDiagram\n    %% Desktop Application Core\n    class TauriApp

The system operates **completely offline** with local LLM integration.\n\n**Core Technologies:**\n- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri (Rust + TypeScript) for lightweight, secure desktop application\n- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Shadcn-ui components, Tailwind CSS\n- **Backend**: Embedded Rust backend with async runtime (Tokio)\n- **Local LLM Integration**: Ollama integration with Llama 3.1, Mistral, or CodeLlama models\n- **3D Engine**: Three.js with React Three Fiber for real-time 3D visualization\n- **Local Database**: SQLite with embedded storage for all application data\n- **Local Network**: Optional LAN-based collaboration using WebRTC\n- **File System**: Direct file system access for CAD exports and asset management\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions:**\n1. **Desktop-First Architecture**: Native desktop performance with OS-level integrations\n2. **Embedded Services Pattern**: All services run as embedded components within the application\n3. **Local-First Data**: All data stored locally with optional network sync\n4. **Offline-Complete Operation**: Full functionality without internet dependency\n5. **Modular Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for additional features\n\n**Open Source Libraries:**\n- **Tauri**: Cross-platform desktop application framework\n- **Ollama**: Local LLM runtime and model management\n- **SQLite**: Embedded database with full-text search\n- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and visualization\n- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer local network collaboration\n- **Serde**: Rust serialization for data handling\n- **Tokio**: Async runtime for Rust backend\n- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching for frontend\n\n## Local LLM Integration Architecture\n\n### 1. Local LLM Service Layer\n\n**Ollama Integration:**\n```rust\n// Rust backend service for LLM integration\npub struct LocalLLMService {\n    ollama_client: OllamaClient,\n    model_manager: ModelManager,\n    vastu_context: VastuContextManager,\n}\n\nimpl LocalLLMService {\n    pub async fn process_design_request(&self, prompt: String) -> Result<DesignResponse> {\n        let enhanced_prompt = self.vastu_context.enhance_prompt(prompt);\n        let response = self.ollama_client.generate(enhanced_prompt).await?;\n        Ok(self.parse_design_response(response))\n    }\n    \n    pub async fn validate_vastu_compliance(&self, design: &DesignData) -> VastuResult {\n        let validation_prompt = self.vastu_context.create_validation_prompt(design);\n        let response = self.ollama_client.generate(validation_prompt).await?;\n        self.parse_vastu_response(response)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Model Management:**\n- **Primary Model**: Llama 3.1 8B for general architectural understanding\n- **Specialized Model**: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B for Vastu-specific reasoning\n- **Code Generation**: CodeLlama for generating CAD export scripts\n- **Automatic Model Download**: First-run setup downloads required models\n- **Model Switching**: Runtime model selection based on task complexity\n\n### 2.

Local Asset Management\n\n**File System Organization:**\n```\n~/VastuArchitect/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 projects/           # User project files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/            # 3D models, textures, materials\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 furniture/     # Furniture 3D models\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 materials/     # Texture and material files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 plants/        # Plant and landscape models\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates/     # Design templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 models/            # LLM model files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 llama-3.1-8b/ # Primary architectural model\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 mistral-7b/   # Vastu-specialized model\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 codellama/     # Code generation model\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 database/          # SQLite database files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 exports/           # Generated CAD files and drawings\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache/             # Temporary and cache files\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/              # Application logs\n```\n\n### 10. CAD Integration and Export\n\n**Local CAD Export Service:**\n```rust\npub struct LocalCADExportService {\n    export_templates: HashMap<CADFormat, ExportTemplate>,\n    file_system: FileSystemService,\n}\n\nimpl LocalCADExportService {\n    pub async fn export_to_dwg(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate DWG file using local libraries\n        let dwg_data = self.generate_dwg_from_design(design).await?;\n        \n        // Save to user-specified location\n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(dwg_data, \"dwg\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n    \n    pub async fn export_to_pdf(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate professional PDF drawings\n        let pdf_data = self.generate_pdf_drawings(design).await?;\n        \n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(pdf_data, \"pdf\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nSeveral aspects require clarification for desktop implementation:\n\n1. **LLM Model Selection**: Which specific local models should be bundled for optimal Vastu understanding\n2. **Asset Library Size**: Balance between comprehensive asset library and application size\n3. **Regional Vastu Variations**: How to package different regional interpretations in offline mode\n4. **Hardware Compatibility**: Minimum system requirements for smooth LLM inference and 3D rendering\n5. **Update Mechanism**: Strategy for updating LLM models and asset libraries without internet\n6. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux\n7. **File Format Support**: Priority order for CAD export formats and compatibility requirements\n8. **Local Network Security**: Security protocols for LAN-based collaboration features\n\nThis desktop architecture provides a complete offline solution while maintaining all the comprehensive design capabilities of the original cloud-based system, with the added benefits of local data control, faster performance, and independence from internet connectivity.</content>\n</Editor.write>\n\n<Editor.write>\n<path>/workspace/vastu_architect_ai_class_diagram.mermaid</path>\n<content>classDiagram\n    %% Desktop Application Core\n    class TauriApp

The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\n - Program call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\n - Anything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path should be \"{{project_name}}_system_design.md\". Use command_name \"end\" when the system design is finished.\n5.

The system operates **completely offline** with local LLM integration.\n\n**Core Technologies:**\n- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri (Rust + TypeScript) for lightweight, secure desktop application\n- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Shadcn-ui components, Tailwind CSS\n- **Backend**: Embedded Rust backend with async runtime (Tokio)\n- **Local LLM Integration**: Ollama integration with Llama 3.1, Mistral, or CodeLlama models\n- **3D Engine**: Three.js with React Three Fiber for real-time 3D visualization\n- **Local Database**: SQLite with embedded storage for all application data\n- **Local Network**: Optional LAN-based collaboration using WebRTC\n- **File System**: Direct file system access for CAD exports and asset management\n\n**Key Architectural Decisions:**\n1. **Desktop-First Architecture**: Native desktop performance with OS-level integrations\n2. **Embedded Services Pattern**: All services run as embedded components within the application\n3. **Local-First Data**: All data stored locally with optional network sync\n4. **Offline-Complete Operation**: Full functionality without internet dependency\n5. **Modular Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for additional features\n\n**Open Source Libraries:**\n- **Tauri**: Cross-platform desktop application framework\n- **Ollama**: Local LLM runtime and model management\n- **SQLite**: Embedded database with full-text search\n- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and visualization\n- **WebRTC**: Peer-to-peer local network collaboration\n- **Serde**: Rust serialization for data handling\n- **Tokio**: Async runtime for Rust backend\n- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching for frontend\n\n## Local LLM Integration Architecture\n\n### 1. Local LLM Service Layer\n\n**Ollama Integration:**\n```rust\n// Rust backend service for LLM integration\npub struct LocalLLMService {\n    ollama_client: OllamaClient,\n    model_manager: ModelManager,\n    vastu_context: VastuContextManager,\n}\n\nimpl LocalLLMService {\n    pub async fn process_design_request(&self, prompt: String) -> Result<DesignResponse> {\n        let enhanced_prompt = self.vastu_context.enhance_prompt(prompt);\n        let response = self.ollama_client.generate(enhanced_prompt).await?;\n        Ok(self.parse_design_response(response))\n    }\n    \n    pub async fn validate_vastu_compliance(&self, design: &DesignData) -> VastuResult {\n        let validation_prompt = self.vastu_context.create_validation_prompt(design);\n        let response = self.ollama_client.generate(validation_prompt).await?;\n        self.parse_vastu_response(response)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Model Management:**\n- **Primary Model**: Llama 3.1 8B for general architectural understanding\n- **Specialized Model**: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B for Vastu-specific reasoning\n- **Code Generation**: CodeLlama for generating CAD export scripts\n- **Automatic Model Download**: First-run setup downloads required models\n- **Model Switching**: Runtime model selection based on task complexity\n\n### 2.

Desktop Security Model\n\n**Local Security Architecture:**\n```rust\n// Desktop security service\npub struct DesktopSecurityService {\n    encryption_key: [u8; 32],\n    file_permissions: FilePermissionManager,\n}\n\nimpl DesktopSecurityService {\n    pub fn encrypt_project_data(&self, data: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {\n        // Encrypt sensitive project data before saving\n        let cipher = ChaCha20Poly1305::new(&self.encryption_key.into());\n        cipher.encrypt(&Nonce::from_slice(b\"unique nonce\"), data.as_bytes())\n    }\n    \n    pub fn secure_asset_access(&self, asset_path: &Path) -> Result<bool> {\n        // Validate asset file integrity and permissions\n        self.file_permissions.validate_access(asset_path)\n    }\n    \n    pub fn sanitize_llm_output(&self, output: &str) -> String {\n        // Remove potentially harmful content from LLM responses\n        self.content_filter.sanitize(output)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Security Features:**\n- **Local Data Encryption**: All project data encrypted at rest\n- **File System Sandboxing**: Restricted file system access\n- **LLM Output Sanitization**: Filter potentially harmful generated content\n- **Network Security**: Optional TLS for local network collaboration\n- **Asset Validation**: Verify integrity of 3D models and textures\n\n### 7. Installation and Distribution\n\n**Desktop Installer:**\n```toml\n# Tauri configuration for desktop distribution\n[tauri]\nbundle = { identifier = \"com.vastuarchitect.app\" }\n\n[tauri.bundle]\ntargets = [\"msi\", \"deb\", \"dmg\", \"appimage\"]\nicon = [\"icons/32x32.png\", \"icons/128x128.png\", \"icons/icon.icns\", \"icons/icon.ico\"]\n\n[tauri.bundle.windows]\ncertificateThumbprint = \"\"\ndigestAlgorithm = \"sha256\"\ntimestampUrl = \"\"\n\n[tauri.bundle.macOS]\nentitlements = \"entitlements.plist\"\nproviderShortName = \"VastuArchitect\"\n\n[tauri.bundle.linux]\nappimage = { bundleMediaFramework = true }\n```\n\n**First-Run Setup:**\n1. **Model Download**: Automatic download of required LLM models (Llama 3.1 8B)\n2. **Asset Library**: Install basic furniture, material, and plant libraries\n3. **Database Initialization**: Create local SQLite database with sample data\n4. **Vastu Rules**: Load comprehensive Vastu Shastra rule database\n5. **User Preferences**: Configure default settings and regional preferences\n\n### 8. Performance Optimization for Desktop\n\n**Local Performance Features:**\n- **Native File I/O**: Direct file system access for faster asset loading\n- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering\n- **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing for LLM inference and rendering\n- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large 3D scenes\n- **Caching Strategy**: Local file-based caching for frequently used assets\n\n**Hardware Requirements:**\n- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, 4-core CPU, integrated graphics, 10GB storage\n- **Recommended**: 16GB RAM, 8-core CPU, dedicated GPU, 50GB storage\n- **LLM Processing**: Additional 8GB RAM for local model inference\n\n### 9. Local Asset Management\n\n**File System Organization:**\n```\n~/VastuArchitect/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 projects/           # User project files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/            # 3D models, textures, materials\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 furniture/     # Furniture 3D models\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 materials/     # Texture and material files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 plants/        # Plant and landscape models\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 templates/     # Design templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 models/            # LLM model files\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 llama-3.1-8b/ # Primary architectural model\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 mistral-7b/   # Vastu-specialized model\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 codellama/     # Code generation model\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 database/          # SQLite database files\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 exports/           # Generated CAD files and drawings\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cache/             # Temporary and cache files\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 logs/              # Application logs\n```\n\n### 10. CAD Integration and Export\n\n**Local CAD Export Service:**\n```rust\npub struct LocalCADExportService {\n    export_templates: HashMap<CADFormat, ExportTemplate>,\n    file_system: FileSystemService,\n}\n\nimpl LocalCADExportService {\n    pub async fn export_to_dwg(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate DWG file using local libraries\n        let dwg_data = self.generate_dwg_from_design(design).await?;\n        \n        // Save to user-specified location\n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(dwg_data, \"dwg\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n    \n    pub async fn export_to_pdf(&self, design: &DesignData) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n        // Generate professional PDF drawings\n        let pdf_data = self.generate_pdf_drawings(design).await?;\n        \n        let export_path = self.file_system.save_export_file(pdf_data, \"pdf\").await?;\n        \n        Ok(export_path)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n\nSeveral aspects require clarification for desktop implementation:\n\n1. **LLM Model Selection**: Which specific local models should be bundled for optimal Vastu understanding\n2. **Asset Library Size**: Balance between comprehensive asset library and application size\n3. **Regional Vastu Variations**: How to package different regional interpretations in offline mode\n4. **Hardware Compatibility**: Minimum system requirements for smooth LLM inference and 3D rendering\n5. **Update Mechanism**: Strategy for updating LLM models and asset libraries without internet\n6. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensuring consistent behavior across Windows, macOS, and Linux\n7. **File Format Support**: Priority order for CAD export formats and compatibility requirements\n8. **Local Network Security**: Security protocols for LAN-based collaboration features\n\nThis desktop architecture provides a complete offline solution while maintaining all the comprehensive design capabilities of the original cloud-based system, with the added benefits of local data control, faster performance, and independence from internet connectivity.</content>\n</Editor.write>\n\n<Editor.write>\n<path>/workspace/vastu_architect_ai_class_diagram.mermaid</path>\n<content>classDiagram\n    %% Desktop Application Core\n    class TauriApp

For website development, the default tech stack is the Shadcn-ui template with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - ALWAYS develop an MVP version of the requirement by taking the easiest way and minimum steps to complete the requirement. Proritize successful completion over perfection.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n - Start by acknowledging the user requirements with RoleZero.reply_to_human and use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template for the project. Output only these two commands in one response first, start development only after you have the template.\n - Before coding, write down an MVP todo.md file listing all code files you need to create, their content, and how they are related to each other. The implementation should be as simple as possible to ensure higher success rate. If the complexity of the requirement is too high, select only the easiest and the most important part to implement, state explicitly your choice. There should be no more thann 8 code files, this is a HARD limit. Throughout the development, always pay attention to the **todo.md** file and adhere to it closely.\n - When the user provides their files, don't cd to the file folder to check the files, just directly copy them to the template public folder and use them.\n2. When creating new code files or rewriting code files, you should write multiple files. Use Editor.write multiple times based on your system design.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n6. After finishing the React/Vue/Shadcn-ui project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you use any new dependencies in your code, make sure to use `pnpm add` to add them. If you encounter any errors, don't skip them, fix them before proceeding. Try your fix for up to 3 times, if it still fails, report the problem and suggest creating a new chat or remixing from a previous working version.\n7. Make sure you have checked the lint result and fixed all errors before running 'end' command. DON'T run 'pnpm run lint' and 'end' command at the same time.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue/Shadcn-ui projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template.\n18. Regarding previewing the project:\n - For projects from React/Vue/Shadcn-ui/Slidev/Remotion/html template, you don't need run dev or preview the project for it is already running and DO NOT modify the config file contents. Simply end after you pass the lint check.\n - For projects from streamlit template, use Previewer.preview_project to enable preview functionality.\n - Pay attention to the chat history. If the user has already previewed the project, don't preview it again.\n - Otherwise, use Terminal to launch a service if applicable. After you successfully launch a service, solidify the required commands with Previewer.preview_project. This tells the user use these commands to put the project into preview. Don't preview the project again if it has been previewed successfully.\n19. When using RoleZero.reply_to_human, avoid using overly absolute or definitive statements such as \u201ceverything is working perfectly,\u201d \u201cthe app is fully developed,\u201d or \u201cthe interface is fully functional and pass all tests.\u201d\n20. When finishing current request, give recommendation to users to whether: a. preview the application in the App Viewer, b. click the publish button to deploy, c. share the link, based on the task type. Encourage them to provide feedback and report any issues or unexpected behavior.\n21. Design principles for visual artifacts: When creating visual artifacts (HTML, React components, or any UI elements):\n- **For complex applications (Three.js, games, simulations)**: Prioritize functionality, performance, and user experience over visual flair. Focus on:\n  - Smooth frame rates and responsive controls\n  - Clear, intuitive user interfaces\n  - Efficient resource usage and optimized rendering\n  - Stable, bug-free interactions\n  - Simple, functional design that doesn't interfere with the core experience\n- **For landing pages, marketing sites, and presentational content**: Consider the emotional impact and \"wow factor\" of the design. Ask yourself: \"Would this make someone stop scrolling and say 'whoa'?\" Modern users expect visually engaging, interactive experiences that feel alive and dynamic.\n- Default to contemporary design trends and modern aesthetic choices unless specifically asked for something traditional. Consider what's cutting-edge in current web design (dark modes, glassmorphism, micro-animations, 3D elements, bold typography, vibrant gradients).\n- Static designs should be the exception, not the rule. Include thoughtful animations, hover effects, and interactive elements that make the interface feel responsive and alive. Even subtle movements can dramatically improve user engagement.\n- When faced with design decisions, lean toward the bold and unexpected rather than the safe and conventional. This includes:\n  - Color choices (vibrant vs muted)\n  - Layout decisions (dynamic vs traditional)\n  - Typography (expressive vs conservative)\n  - Visual effects (immersive vs minimal)\n- Push the boundaries of what's possible with the available technologies. Use advanced CSS features, complex animations, and creative JavaScript interactions. The goal is to create experiences that feel premium and cutting-edge.\n- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast and semantic markup\n- Create functional, working demonstrations rather than placeholders\n\n<Template>\n\n### react_template Template Intro\n1. It is based on React framework with Tailwind CSS. The template includes the basic structure of a React project, including an index.html file and a src directory with an App.jsx file.\n Modify index.html to change web title, create new jsx files under src if needed, and rewrite src/App.jsx to meet the user's requirements. You should NOT modify src/main.jsx and src/index.css. Modify vite.config.js only if extra config is absolutely necessary.\n Style your elements with Tailwind CSS classes directly in the jsx files.\n2. The template is at /workspace/react_template.\n3. The following files are required to be known: index.html, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/index.css, vite.config.js\n4. The following fields could be modified: \n5.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",
